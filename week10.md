# Week Ten

It's the end of week 10, and we're in the middle of the backend project. As I hoped, my group was able to implement nearly all of our stretch goals. The last and most involved was enabling dark/light modes by swapping bootstrap for a new front-end framework called Halfmoon. While it retains a lot of the bootstrap class names, I had to spend most of today correcting the navbars, modals, and spacing issues caused by the change. We'll keep working on dialing everything in and hopefully merge it to the main branch sometime this weekend. 

The prompt this week asked me to reflect again on my decision to attend DigitalCrafts. It has been nothing short of transformative. When I decided to resign from my position at Reinhardt University, I hoped that I would find coding at least mostly as enjoyable and rewarded as teaching and performing music. I did not expect that I would be having the most fun I've had in years! It has been amazing having this time each day to focus on my skills, and I absolutely love the structure of the program -- building from basic development principles up through python, front-end, back-end, and then react. It's a very logical progression, and it's clear that the folks at DC have put a lot of thought into keeping it optimized for the job market. Speaking of the job market, I'm looking forward to career week next week. Until then!
