# Week One
<html>

Wow! Week one is already done, and I'm feeling pretty great about my decision to enroll in the DigitalCrafts immersive program. Thanks to the prework and some free courses I took in 2017, most of the material so far isn't new. But, I'm filling in important gaps in my knowledge and applying the concepts in lots of different ways. I've pushed things to git before but only from an IDE. It's been very fun to learn how to do everything from the command line. 

I thought I wanted to go in to Atlanta Tech Village every day, but that only lasted two days!! I guess it's just not the same with everyone else remote; the advantage of being in person is the camaraderie and teamwork -- the in-between moments. Also the dual monitors, but I couldn't get my MBP to recognize the display. At home, I've got a nice workflow. My trusty old mac mini handles google drive (notes) and the learning portal while the new MBP runs zoom, iterm2, and VSCode. So far, it's working great, although I'm definitely going to need a better chair soon. 

I think we have a good mix of people in our cohort, and I believe that peoples' personalities will start to show a little bit more next week as everyone gets more comfortable with the routine. Sean's warm demeanor puts everyone at ease, so I think it will happen quicker than expected, even with the very introverted folks.
