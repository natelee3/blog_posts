# Week Six

I am exhausted after spending the whole week on our front-end project! It's a lot more taxing to spend 6 hours per day writing code, pushing commits, and communicating with a group than our normal schedule -- a mix of listening to lectures, code-alongs, and small exercises. Still, we had plenty of time to bring our idea to life. 

We had several ideas but ended up choosing the very first one, which was originally going to be called "Dinner Decider." My idea was to facilitate quick decisions about where to eat -- a challenge that most people face often. We also considered a sports odds website and a party planning app that would find you an excuse to throw a party any day of the year.

My primary role in the group was to build our scripts.js file. After we built the html structure together, Jay and I spent the rest of Monday working on the javascript. We had to acquire keys to the five APIs, grab the user inputs with querySelectors, and build the fetch functions. 

With the APIs in place, the rest of the week was spent refining the styling and responsiveness. I did encounter a couple of larger problems, including an error-ridden POST request, that I had to get help with, but we managed to get everything working as we wanted.

If we had more time, I would have liked to input our user and location coordinates directly into the mapbox so that directions would pop up automatically. I was pretty close but just ran out of time...

And now on to backend!!
