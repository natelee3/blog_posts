# Week Eleven

Last week was a whirlwind! We finished and presented our projects on Monday, and our group was able to show off all the hard work we did on linkify. If you want to check it out, visit our new deployment at linkify.link (which is what we worked on Tuesday). It's deployed on an AWS ec2 instance I made following the instructions [here](https://github.com/seanrreid/deploying-on-aws). 

Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday were 'career days' led by our director of Student Success, Angela. She led us through presentations and exercises on digital presence (GitHub, Linkedin, social media), resumes (ATS and creative), and portfolio websites. It was interesting to see how employers use LinkedIn recruiter tools to sort and filter, and I made a few changes to my page as a result. I'm still tweaking the mobile responsiveness on my portfolio page -- I created a node/express app from scratch instead of using a template -- but it's not deployed on another instance of my ec2 server and hosted at [natelee.dev](https://natelee.dev). I went with a minimalist theme for now, but I think the detailed project descriptions will be helpful for anyone interested in hiring me.

Next week, React!!
