# Week Three

We began the week by presenting our python projects. I was very happy with how much functionality we were able to develop in just a few days, and I think our oregon-trail based game was a big hit. My team worked well together, and the whole process was very enjoyable. 

The rest of the week was spent tackling the twisted beautiful mess that is CSS. I have a lot still to learn about designing front ends and making use of all the features CSS offers. When I learned HTML (circa 2000), any styles were done inline, like this: `<p align center>` and there were html tags for everything. I like the separation of concerns, and I look forward to continuing to develop my knowledge and skills. 

Even though we're moving on to javascript, I'm planning to do some extra CSS work daily to keep sharpening my skillset. I've also begun a new repository to hold all my ProjectEuler solutions. Thanks for reading!
