# Week Twelve

Three quarters of the way through!

The prompt for today was about redoing a project, and there's no doubt that [Linkify](https://linkify.link) could be even stronger with a React frontend. My group was just discussing some edits we want to make, and react would make some of them so much easier!! Right now when a user logs in, we check their password field against the password-confirm field. If they don't match, we reload a /login-failure page that prints a message "Passwords don't match." We'd like to keep the values in the username and password fields and just reset the password-confirm to null, but I don't think it's possible in node without redirecting/reloading. React would allow us to run our password authorization function without reloading the page.
