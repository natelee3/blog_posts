# Week Seven

One of the things I've enjoyed most about the DigitalCrafts program has been the variety programmed into the curriculum. So far, we've had a mix of
- Presentations from Sean on new topics
- Code-alongs
- Small (2-4) group assignments
- Extended group project work
- Guest presentations
- Algorithm practice with the TAs 
- "Fix this broken code" assignments
Plus supplemental reading and videos to watch

After a long week of project work last week, it was nice to get back to basics, so to speak. We're diving into back-end development, and I'm honestly not sure I have a preference between it and front-end. Data structures and programming logic comes a lot more naturally to me than page styling, but right now I'm hoping for a position that will allow me to do some of both. Maybe with a little more time I'll change my opinion, but it can't be bad to love everything. 

The job search is right around the corner!
