# Week Five

As we get ready for front-end projects next week, I'm asked to look back on a previous group project from before DigitalCrafts. That's easy to do, because as a musician-- nearly everything I did was a group project. I've performed hundreds of concerts, and each one required collaboration.

I am an extra percussionist with the Charleston Symphony, which means that I'm on call for whenever they need more than the 2 percussionists on their permanent roster. That process starts months ahead of time. Once the music is selected by the music director, the personnel manager reaches out to hire any extra players that are needed. Librarians acquire the sheet music and distribute it to the players. I typically receive my assignments about a month before the performance. My part of the project is to show up to the first rehearsal (1-3 days before the performance) absolutely prepared - performance-ready. 

In rehearsal, the music director makes any changes in balance, tempo, or style to achieve their vision for the piece. We use the dress rehearsal to run the entire concert in order, just as a group runs their presentation before demo day. A successful concert requires each of us to do our part and to trust that the others are doing theirs. 

This is the attitude I will carry into next week's projects. I will do everything I can not only to help my group produce a great front-end webpage but also to ensure that everyone in the group has a chance to grow and contribute.
