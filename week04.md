# Week Four

We are officially a quarter of the way through the program! The prompt for this week's entry is to write about an app that's needed but doesn't exist yet. I don't know that I have any million-dollar ideas just yet, but here's a start...

As a professional musician, I was constantly searching for better ways to log and track my pratice. There have been numerous attempts to solve this problem, but I don't find any of the existing applications to fit exactly what I'd like. A great product would have:
    - an onboard timer to track the overall session and auto-record it into your log with annotations.
    - a stopwatch to track smaller intervals (eg- different tempi for an excerpt, loop this exercise for 1 min)
    - storage for exercises/practice routines that you repeat regularly
    - ability to report total and average statistics over custom time periods (eg- how many hours did I practice xylophone last month?)
    - ability to set and track progress toward tempo goals, mastery goals, and weekly standards
    - voice memo storage and/or ability to record/playback at different speeds
    - An advanced feature could allow you to set a color theme, much like browsers do

I'm a big fan of the Strong app for tracking my weightlifting routines, and I think it could serve as a decent model to build off. The structure and layout are simple and interactions are intuitive. As my skills improve, maybe I'll try to flesh these ideas out a little more. 

Until next time!
