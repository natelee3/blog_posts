# Week Nine

I'm making this entry a couple days late, because my wife and I just got back from celebrating our tenth wedding anniversary in Savannah, GA. Some highlights:
* Jogging and walking around the resort and riverfront
* Fun exploring river street and the newly-created "Plant Riverside" district (the JW Marriot has a full museum in the lobby!)
* Of course, eating some great food (we definitely recommend [Cotton and Rye](http://www.cottonandrye.com/) and [Zunzi's](https://www.zunzis.com/zunzis-savannah-menu/))
* Seeing live music
* Watching the fireworks display over the Savannah River

We've been to Savannah a number of times now, but we always seem to find new things to do and explore!

On the DigitalCrafts front, we started backend projects today (Tuesday). My group is working on a url shortening app ala bitly.com. I'm excited about all the cool features we're going to be able to add now that we've got the site running. What I appreciate most about the group projects is seeing all the creative things my teammates do with their code. I always pick up some new ideas or new ways to do things!
