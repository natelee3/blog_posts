#Week Two

Week two is in the books, and things are going great. As we finish up our first python group project, I wanted to take a minute to reflect on why I decided to enroll with DigitalCrafts. 

After 4 years of undergraduate work, 2 years of master's, 5 years of doctoral study, 4 years teaching high school percussion, and 4 years teaching college percussion I reached a turning point in my musical career. My adjunct role at Reinhardt University was fulfilling but didn't offer any promise of advancement. With hardly any open positions in the country, I began to feel stuck.

I had experimented with programming in 2017 by taking a Flatiron School bootcamp prep course and really enjoyed it. When the idea surfaced again this year, I began investigating possible options.

DigitalCrafts was a strong contender from the beginning. My brother-in-law is a senior developer at Cox Automotive and spoke highly of a member of his team who recently graduated from the DigitalCrafts bootcamp. I also liked that the course began in python instead of ruby and seems to cover everything I'd need. 

The interview process, unlike some other bootcamps, was low-pressure and encouraging. What really sold me on enrolling was the obvious commitment to career services. The other programs I looked into offered 3-6 months of career services access after graduation, but DigitalCrafts gives you access indefinitely. Their willingness to stand by their graduates told me a lot about their motives and priorities. 

At the end of two weeks, I'm having a great time and learning A LOT. More updates coming soon!
