# Week Eight

Week 8 of 16. We are halfway there, and this week we finished putting together the Model-View-Controller. It's going to take a little getting used to, but I can definitely see the advantages of using node.js over plain html/css/js. I fought with CORS and general security issues on the front-end project, but node has all sorts of features to deal with security. 

Also, I have my first job interview next week (!!). I'm excited to show potential employers what I'm capable of, and my wife (director of HR at Site One) has been helping me prep for the interview. I know I still have a lot to learn, but I'm feeling confident in how quickly I'm progressing. 

My next full-stack app is going to be a percussion-based review site. I have 20+ years of experience trying, buying, and selling percussion gear so I have a great handle on how different brands stack up and who is making quality stuff. I don't think there are any relevant public APIs for this, so I'll have to write the database myself. 

More to come!
